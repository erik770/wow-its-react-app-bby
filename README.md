# About this project

### What is it in a nutshell?

### `It's a simple blog app`

### Main goal of project

This is my first time writing an application using the React library. In this application, I tried to put most of my
knowledge about React into practice. I practiced creating and using various components and hooks (useState, useEffect,
useMemo, useRef, useContext, useFetching, usePosts) used decomposition in almost all places, which makes it easy to
expand the functionality of this application. Also, the component approach used here allows me to reuse my components,
which I actively did during development. I also learned how to use devtools for react applications, and got acquainted
with react router
